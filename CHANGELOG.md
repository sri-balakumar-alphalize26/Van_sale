# Changelog

All notable changes to the mobile app are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the
project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for app versions
(`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

When bumping, edit BOTH `package.json` and `app.json` so they stay in
sync. Also bump `app.json -> expo.ios.buildNumber` (string) and
`app.json -> expo.android.versionCode` (integer) for every store-bound
build.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- **Company switching in Profile.** On a server with several companies, Profile
  shows a **Company** row; tap it, pick a company and confirm. Registers,
  products, customers and every other list then show only that company's data,
  like the company switcher in the web backend. With a single company the row
  just shows its name. The choice is remembered for the next login.
- **Customer Due banner without the server module.** The yellow due banner on an
  order and the amber "Due" pill in My Orders now also show when the server
  doesn't have the dynamic-invoice module: the app shows what the customer owes
  right now. With the module installed, the balance at the time of sale is shown
  as before.
- **Opening Balance tile (Accounting).** Enter old customers' credit balances
  from the paper records, by age (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 91–120, >120 days), and
  post them without anyone opening the web backend.
  - The customer picker shows the customer list straight away and filters as
    you type. "Create <name>" opens the customer form, and the new customer
    comes back selected.
  - Entries are kept on the phone until they're published.
  - **Publish** asks for the admin's login password, which the server checks;
    it's never stored. The app then builds the same Excel file the accountants
    used to upload and runs it through the existing opening-balance import. It
    checks every line before importing and posts the journal entry.
  - If the server doesn't answer, Retry picks up where the publish stopped and
    never posts twice.
  - If the server doesn't have the opening-balance module, the screen says so
    and Publish is disabled.
  - A yellow ⚠️ note asks to check every amount twice as soon as one is typed,
    and again before publishing, since posted balances can't be changed or
    published again.

### Fixed
- **Place Order failed with a server error on some registers** of a
  multi-company database (e.g. a register of company 2): the order and its
  payment were always created under company 1. They now use the register's own
  company, falling back to the company chosen in Profile.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- **Return Products failed outright** with an Odoo `AccessError` about `account.tax`.
  Products shared across companies carry every company's sale tax, and the app
  summed all of them with no company filter — so a GROCERY SHOP line was booked
  with both 15% (company 1) and 5.75% (company 3). That overcharged **20.75%
  instead of 15%**, and stamped each line with a tax the POS session cannot read
  back, which is what made Odoo refuse the refund while recomputing its prices.
  Product taxes are now filtered to the register's company, mirroring Odoo's
  `account.tax._filter_taxes_by_company` including the parent-company walk.
- **The register's company is no longer hard-coded to 1**, so on a multi-company
  database an order is booked against the POS it was actually rung on.
- **A paid return was not linked to the order it came from.** Odoo's linked
  refund draft was discarded and a standalone negative order written in its
  place, with no `refunded_orderline_id`. Odoo therefore never marked the
  original as returned: the same item could be refunded again from any other
  device, the refund carried no `REFUND` name, and partial returns could not be
  tracked. Also fixed the id taken from `sync_from_ui` — once a line carries the
  refund link Odoo returns `[original_id, new_refund_id]`, and reading the first
  entry re-paid the order being refunded and decremented its stock twice.
- **Returned goods were never put back on hand.** The stock fallback skipped
  every refund line via a `qty <= 0` guard; non-storable products are now
  skipped instead, since Odoo keeps no quants for them.
- **Refund orders looked like ordinary refundable sales.** `refunded_order_id`
  and `refund_orders_count` were requested from Odoo but dropped before reaching
  the screen, so a refund showed no `REFUND` chip, no "Refunded from" link, and
  still offered a Return Products button — letting a cashier refund a refund.
- **Quantity steppers on return lines.** A return line carries a negative
  quantity, which the controls never accounted for: `−` deleted the whole line
  instead of stepping `-8 → -9`, `+` ran to `0` and left an empty line, and
  typing a quantity turned `-1` into `+1` — a sale booked on a refund order.
  `+` now returns fewer units, `−` returns more, both capped at the quantity
  actually sold. **Piece-wise returns (return 2 of 10) work for the first time.**
- Refund failures now surface Odoo's actual message in a modal that stays on
  screen, instead of a two-second toast that discarded it.

### Changed
- App display name is now **NEXGENN Van-Sale** (was `NEXGENN VAN-SALE`).
- Android package is now `com.alphalize.vansale` (was `com.alphalize.goldenspoon`).

### Notes
- **The package change makes this a different application to Android.** Existing
  installs of `com.alphalize.goldenspoon` will not update to it — the two sit
  side by side, and the new one starts with no data, so devices must be
  re-registered. Any Play Store listing stays bound to the old package.
- Historical orders placed before this release keep the 20.75% they were charged.
  Returns of them refund exactly what was paid, which is intended; deciding
  whether to compensate those customers is a commercial call.
- `app.json` is generated by `generateAppJson.js` from `.env` via `getConfig`.
  The name, package and version above were set by hand, so running that
  generator will overwrite them with `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_NAME_ALPHA` /
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_PACKAGE_NAME_ALPHA` unless `.env` is updated to match.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Customer Due saved on the order.** What a customer owed is now recorded on
  the sale itself rather than recomputed on every print. Four stored fields on
  `pos.order` (Previous Due / This Order Due / Total Due, plus a captured flag),
  written once when the app finishes a sale and frozen from then on — reopening
  an old order shows what was owed on that day, not today.
- **Due pill on the Orders list.** Rows carrying a due show an amber
  `Due <amount>` pill beside the Receipt and Tax pills.
- **Customer Due card** on the Order Detail screen, and a **Due chip** in its
  action row.
- **Due breakdown popup**, opened from either the pill or the chip. Shows the
  frozen totals from the sale alongside the customer's open invoices as they
  stand now — labelled separately, because once the customer pays, the two
  legitimately differ.

### Fixed
- The "Thank you for your purchase!" note at the end of the post-payment
  preview could not be scrolled into view — the sticky footer floated over it
  and the scroll area reserved too little room. The footer is now measured, so
  the reserved space matches whatever it actually renders (it varies: the
  "PDF (Credit)" chip is conditional).
- A credit sale recorded This Order Due as 0. `pos.order.amount_paid` counts the
  Customer Account tender as paid, so the linked invoice's residual is used
  instead.

### Notes
- Requires `pos_dynamic_invoice` **19.0.31.0.0** or later for the due fields.
  Without it the app degrades quietly: no pills, no card, and every other screen
  behaves exactly as before.
- Orders placed before this release, or created outside the app, carry no
  snapshot and show no due — the captured flag is what distinguishes them from a
  customer who genuinely owes nothing.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Invoice Settings rebuilt as a three-screen hub per company: **General
  Settings**, **Receipt Paper Sizes** and **Invoice Layouts**.
- **Invoice Template** picker (Standard / Dynamic / Cash Memo / Custom
  Layout) replaces the old "Use Dynamic Invoice on App" master switch,
  with a server-rendered Preview against the most recent order.
- **Cash Memo** receipt: a bilingual English/Arabic Oman-style invoice
  with C.R. number, GSM, Sultanate line and VAT number (each with its own
  show/hide switch), an enlarged logo, and a cashier/customer signature
  row.
- **Receipt Paper Sizes** admin: sizes entered in inches with the mm
  width derived automatically, height 0 for a continuous roll,
  reorder/edit/delete, plus a locked per-company "Custom" entry. Replaces
  the fixed 2"/3"/3.5"/4" preset list.
- **Invoice Layouts** admin and a landscape drag-and-drop visual editor
  (Design / Options / Live Preview) with per-paper-size block layouts,
  undo/redo and auto-save.
- **Use Default Receipt Size**: when set, Preview / Download / Print skip
  the size prompt in both the app and the Odoo preview.
- **Customer due on receipts**: a Previous Due card on the POS payment
  screen, and Previous Due / This Invoice / Total Due rows on every
  receipt template when the customer still owes money.
- **Print PDF** on accounting invoices — renders through the shop's own
  invoice template and paper size, alongside the unchanged Download PDF.
- Products: unit-of-measure management (Add Unit, reference units),
  multi-category assignment, a Track Inventory toggle, Dozen Display
  (pieces per dozen, on-hand in dozens, "Dozen + Pcs" readout), delete
  with an archive fallback, and a Show Archived / Restore flow.
- Partner Ledger filters: posting status, review, reconciliation,
  journal, account type and date/invoice-date periods, with removable
  chips and a pinned grand-total row.
- In-app **User Manual** tile plus a HELP card on Profile, with a
  per-device "Show to users" toggle for administrators.

### Changed
- All receipt sizes now print at 100% on a single continuous page instead
  of being scaled or split.
- Customer returns support partial quantities, with tax locked to what
  was originally charged and scaled to the quantity returned; refund
  orders carry a REFUND badge and a link back to the original sale.
- Quick Return shows Purchased / Already Returned / Max Returnable per
  line with clamping validation, and a "Return all" shortcut.
- Profile avatar is now the user's initial rather than a generic image.

### Fixed
- New products no longer fail to create on databases without a default
  internal category.
- Product save now enables only when something has actually changed, and
  a category created inline appears immediately.
- Partner Ledger value display and filtering corrected.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Dynamic POS invoice: a branded, editable receipt (logo, shop name,
  address, GST/VAT number, header title, footer, show/hide the tax row
  and signatures) rendered server-side at all paper sizes. New Odoo
  module `pos_dynamic_invoice`, gated by a per-company "Use Dynamic
  Invoice on App" master switch.
- In-app Invoice Settings admin (Home → Administration → Invoice
  Settings): a per-company list plus an editor to toggle dynamic mode
  and edit all branding, logo, header/footer and show/hide options.
  Edits share the same record as the Odoo back office.
- Customer and cashier signature capture on the receipt.
- In-app user manual, with per-user hide/unhide.

### Changed
- App renamed to NEXGENN VAN-SALE.
- White background behind the NEXGENN POS logo on the profile page.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- POS order GPS capture on Validate Payment, with a Location chip on
  the post-payment receipt and the past-order detail screen. New Odoo
  module: `pos_order_location` (19.0.1.0.1).
- App Banners admin (in-app screens + new `app_banner` Odoo module
  19.0.2.0.0). 3:1 crop on upload via `expo-image-picker`, kanban
  view in the Odoo backend with 3:1 cards, header Archive / Delete
  buttons, chatter audit trail.
- Invoice paper-size picker (2" / 3" / 3.5" / 4") that fires before
  Preview / Download / Print on both the post-payment receipt and the
  past-order detail.
- Apps Privileges admin overhaul (rename, Hide All / Reset All bulk
  actions, ConfirmModal popups).
- Login-time location-permission prompt (asks once per install via
  `AsyncStorage` flag).
- `ConfirmModal` component — centered LogoutModal-style popup that
  replaces the system `Alert.alert` for destructive flows like banner
  delete.

### Changed
- Home tiles redesigned to a 2-column horizontal-row layout. Each tile
  carries the parent section's accent as a left stripe; titles fit on
  one line; tap target is wider.
- `OrderDetailScreen` items now render product images (fetched via a
  follow-up `product.product` read) and use a bidi-safe qty x price
  meta line that no longer reorders around the Arabic currency symbol.
- `Home` carousel banner card locked to 3:1 aspect on every device, so
  what the admin uploads at 3:1 displays without `cover`-cropping.

### Removed
- Local `assets/images/Home/Banner` fallback. The Home carousel only
  ever shows banners served by the `app.banner` Odoo module now.
- Sequence field UI on the banner admin (the column stays in the
  schema for backward compatibility; the app sends a constant `10`).
- Re-crop entry points on the Banners admin (the in-app crop screen
  and the navigator route). The first-time gallery picker's 3:1 crop
  is enough.

## [1.1.0] - prior release
- First publicly distributed version of the app. No detailed changelog
  was kept before this entry.
